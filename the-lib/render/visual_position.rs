//! Visual position helpers (placeholder).
//!
//! This module will host soft-wrap aware coordinate transforms and utilities
//! that depend on rendering state (formatting, annotations, decorations).
//! It is intentionally empty for now; visual position APIs will be moved here
//! from `position.rs` once the render stack is ported.
